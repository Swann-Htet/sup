            Over the past year, we've shared some incredible moments together. I want you to know that from the very beginning, I've had deep feelings for you. Admitting that I love you for the first time was a bit intimidating, as I have some reservations and fears about love. However, I've come to realize that the time we've spent together has been nothing short of amazing, and I don't want to lose you.

Although 2023 has been a challenging year for me, the silver lining has been discovering you. You've brought so much positivity into my life, and I truly appreciate that. Despite my initial hesitation, I now find myself wanting to embrace love with you by my side. Could you consider loving me back?
